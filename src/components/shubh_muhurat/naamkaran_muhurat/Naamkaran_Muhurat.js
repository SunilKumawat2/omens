The choice of a suitable date and time for this ceremony is believed to influence the child's life, character, and destiny. Astrology plays a significant role in determining the ideal moment for the Namkaran ceremony.</p>

                <li><b>Consult an Astrologer:</b> It's advisable to consult with a knowledgeable astrologer who can provide you with a personalised Muhurat based on the child's birth details.</li>
