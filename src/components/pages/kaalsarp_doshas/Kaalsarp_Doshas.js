                        <h1>12 Kaalsarp Doshas</h1>
                        <p>Kaalsarp dosh in astrology is considered as one of the most concerning doshas. According to astrology, Kaalsarp dosh is a result of one's past deeds or karma. The presence of this dosh in your kundli may create hurdles and delays across different aspects of your life such as career, love, marriage, health and more. The Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu and Ketu are present on one side in the horoscope and all other planets are in their midst.</p>
                        <p>As per astrology, there are seven main planets (excluding Rahu and Ketu), each of them ruling various aspects such as Lagna, wealth, happiness, children, disease, household, age, fortune, karma, profit, love, expenditure, etc. As Kaalsarp dosh veils the planets, the aspects they represent may get hampered, which may lead to problems in the life of the native. In astrology, there are as many as 12 Kaalsarp doshas. Each of these forms as per the placement of Rahu and Ketu in the native's chart.</p>
                        <p>Having said that, here are 12 Kaalsharp doshas in kundli and remedies to tackle each of them.</p>
                        <h3>1. Anant Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>The Anant Kaalsarp dosh is formed in the native's chart when the planet Rahu is present in the lagna or the first house of the Kundli, and Ketu is present in the 7th house. In this way, all the remaining planets come in between the two shadow planets. When the native has this dosh in his Kundli, he will have to struggle for longer to find success. Although you will work very hard in order to succeed, but the results will come to you after a delay. The Anant Kaalsarp dosh will likely test your patience by introducing you to constant obstacles and challenges. Due to this dosha, a person faces problems in all aspects of their lives, but if you don't lose hope, you will find success later. Also, don't indulge in ill deeds such as gambling, lust, etc.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Anant Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a student, you should chant the ‘Saraswati Mantra‘ and ‘Saraswatye Namah‘ for 10-15 minutes daily.</li>
                            <li>On Saturday, hoist the raw coal upside down 8 times; flush the coal into running water.</li>
                            <li>Reading Hanuman Chalisa five times a day for 40 days will also help.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>2. Kulik Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>Kulik Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 2nd house and Ketu is in the 8th house of the native's kundli. This dosha is believed to bring economic losses, humiliation, debt and various other obstacles in the native's life. Hence astrologers suggest that you don't form bondings with people without careful scrutiny. If you are into business, make sure you do it with 100% honesty, especially during the Kulik dosh period. When it comes to married life, it is to remain normal for the native dealing with Kalik dosh. You, however, may feel that you are getting old before time, thus you must invest in taking care of your health. Do not use intoxicants such as cigarettes, tobacco, etc.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Kulik Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wear an opened copper bracelet tightly fitted on the right hand on Tuesday.</li>
                            <li>On Saturday, you must light a lamp of mustard oil in front of the Hanuman idol in the evening.</li>
                            <li>Hold energised Silver Rahu Yantra on Saturday</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>3. Vasuki Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>Vasuki Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 3rd house in the native's chart and Ketu, on the other hand, sits in the 9th place. This dosha doesn't only hamper the life of the native but also of the ones related to him, such as his siblings, parents, spouse, etc. You have to face the fact that your family members may cheat on you. There will likely be a lack of peace in the family, and the peace will further shatter with inflating economic problems as the Vasuki Kaalsarp dosh continues. However, the good thing is that the person will have economic success as he continues to put in the hard work in making sure things work out for him.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Vasuki Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read Hanuman Chalisa and Bajrang Baan 5 times for 40 days.</li>
                            <li>Hold energised the Silver Rahu Yantra on Saturday for Vasuki Kaalsarp Yoga.</li>
                            <li>Every Wednesday keep a handful of Urad dal in a black cloth, and chant the Rahu spell mantra and flow the Urad in the water.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>4. Shankhapal Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>The Shankphal Kaalsarp dosh is formed in the native's Kundli when the planet Rahu is placed in the 4th house of the Kundli and the planet Ketu sits in the 10th house. The formation of this yoga in kundli is the signal of incoming financial hardship, disease and disorder in the native's life. Hence, he/she should prepare for it. During this period, the happiness in the native's family will plunge to new lows. This may further hamper elements such as love, child's education, etc. If a youngster, the native will find it tough to make the right choices, due to which he or she may find it difficult to settle early in life. The people of this yoga have to face difficulties related to land and property, thus any such deals must be done after proper scrutiny.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Shankhapal Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hang Hanuman Bahuk in red cloth on any Tuesday on the wall towards the south side of the house.</li>
                            <li>Put a silver serpent or peacock feathers at the entrance of the house.</li>
                            <li>On any Friday, flush the water coconut in water during the day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>5. Padam Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>Padam Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 5th house and Ketu is in the 11th house of the kundli. This dosh is especially harmful to students as they may lose concentration in studies and indulge in detrimental deeds. Hence, parents must keep an eye on their children during this period. You also need to ensure you help your child make the right choices in education or it will simply cost you and him a loss of money and time. For grown-ups, the dosh may hamper your progress in your career. If you are looking for new opportunities or taking risks, you must do it with a partner. Also, health should be a priority as the Padam Kaalsarp dosh progresses.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Padam Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wear a triangular Coral gemstone of seven and a quarter with copper in the middle finger of the right hand on any Tuesday.</li>
                            <li>Keep a Peacock feather in the books on Saturday.</li>
                            <li>On Tuesday, at the main entrance of the house, put a copper made Naga Nagin tied in red clothes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>6. Mahapadma Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>The Mahapadma Kaalsarp dosh is formed when the planet Rahu is placed in the 6th house of the Kundli and Ketu is placed in the 12th house. Although Kaalsarp doshas are known for their ill consequences, but when Mahapadma Kaalsarp dosh is active, the native finds himself the luck to win over all his enemies with ease. There is an enhancement in wisdom and a thrust of will to do something worthwhile and big in life. However, as the dosh period continues, the native tends to lose peace of mind and may make thoughtless choices. In the dosh period, the person earns profit from business from abroad.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Mahapadma Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is necessary to visit the Hanuman idol in the morning on Tuesday.</li>
                            <li>Recite Hanuman Chalisa once in a day for 40 days.</li>
                            <li>Recite Sunderkand of Ramcharitmanas on Tuesday or Saturday 108 times.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>7. Takshak Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>The Takshak Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Rahu is placed in the 7th house of the Kundli and Ketu is in the lagan or the 1st house. If this dosh is active in the life of the native, he or she may have to face a delay in marriage. The marriage delay may become the reason for tension and stress for your parents too. If married, there may be disturbances due to the nature of the in-laws. There may also arise situations when you might think of divorce. Also, the ones dealing with Kaalsarp dosh must not consider love marriage during the dosh period. Doing so will hamper the love you share after marriage, and you will have to put extra effort to make things work.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Takshak Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recite Sunderkand of Ramcharitmanas on Tuesday or Saturday 108 times.</li>
                            <li>Read Ganapati Atharvashirsha on every full moon.</li>
                            <li>Wear an energized Silver Rahu Yantra around your neck.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>8. Karkotak Kaalsarp dosh</h3>
                        <p>The Karkotak Kaalsarp dosh is formed when Ketu is placed in the 2nd house of the native's Kundli and Rahu is placed in the 8th house. The Karkotak Kaalsarp dosh is responsible for causing hindrance in acquiring a fortune. The dosh may also hamper career progress as you may witness several hindrances in acquiring a job and getting a well-deserved promotion. People dealing with Karkotak Kaalsarp dosh also acquire the habit of speaking the truth. This may seem like a good thing, but this habit may bar the native from acquiring good deals for himself. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't speak the truth, but you must surely think before speaking to anyone.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Karkotak Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wear Shiva Yantra made of silver around the neck.</li>

                            <li>Wear a triangular Coral gemstone in copper on the middle finger of the right hand.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>9. Shankhachur Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>Shankhachur Kaalsarp dosh is formed when the planet Rahu is placed in the 6th house and Ketu, on the other hand, occupies the 12th house of the Kundli. The good thing about this dosh is that the desires of people born in this dosh are usually fulfilled. However, the bad thing is that there may be a delay in fulfilling such desires, which may leave you frustrated. In the family and home of the native dealing with Shankhachur Kaalsarp dosh, there may be a lot of pain and suffering. In this period, it is suggested that you focus on your family and don't indulge in dealings that you will have to regret in the near future.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Shankhachur Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recite Hanuman Chalisa daily.</li>
                            <li>Regularly recite Mahamrityunjaya Mantra and observe fasting every Monday.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>10. Ghatak Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>As per astrologers, the Ghatak Kaalsarp dosh is formed in Kundli when Rahu is placed in the 10th house and Ketu sits in the 4th house of the native's kundli. When you have this dosha in kundli, it is highly recommended that you serve your mother, take care of her and never cause her any harm. This will help in bettering your life conditions. However, it has been noticed that in return, you may not get the same kind of affection from your mother. Due to Ghatak Kaalsarp dosh, the person becomes arrogant even if he or she does not have anything to be proud of. Your ego is at the top of your head, which may hamper not only your personal but your professional bondings too.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Ghatak Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always read the Hanuman Chalisa and observe fast each Tuesday.</li>
                            <li>Read Ganapati Atharvashirsha on every full moon.</li>
                            <li>On Friday, donate coconut, blanket etc. along with epilogue, oil, black cloth, and peel.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>11. Vishdhar Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>The Vishdhar Kaalsarp dosh is formed when planet Rahu is in the 11th house and Ketu, on the other hand, sits in the 5th house. This dosha is fatal for the one trying to acquire education, especially higher education. There will be a lot of obstacles for such a person to get higher education. However, despite all odds, their patience and commitment will help them in moving forward. These people do better in their professional life if they pursue their career from abroad than from their own country. Their fortune trends in foreign countries. In the family, the person has to suffer from property loss even after the possibility of benefiting from grandparents.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Vishdhar Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Feed barley grains to the needy for 27 days on Saturday.</li>
                            <li>On Saturday, circumambulate the raw coal anti-clockwise around your head 8 times, then throw the coal in the running water.</li>
                            <li>Recite Hanuman Chalisa daily.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>12. Sheshnag Kaalsarp Dosh</h3>
                        <p>The Sheshnag Kaal Sarp dosh is formed when the Rahu is present in the 12th house of the Kundli and the Ketu planet sits in the 6th house. The desires of the people born in this Sheshnag Kaalsarp Yog are always fulfilled, however, with a slight delay. The native under the presence of this dosh may develop a habit of spending more than his income. This is why he may usually find himself indebted. After 42 years of age, there is a time in his life when he may find himself a prestigious place in society. This, however, will require your constant hard work and commitment.</p>
                        <h4>Remedies for Sheshnag Kaalsarp Dosh</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hang Hanuman Bahuk wrapped in red cloth on any Tuesday on the wall towards the south side of the house.</li>
                            <li>Feed the raw bread of barley flour to the birds for 3 months</li>
                            <li>Wear an energised Shiva Yantra made of silver around the neck.</li>
